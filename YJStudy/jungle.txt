A jungle is land covered with dense vegetation. Application of the term has varied greatly during the last several centuries, both because of this ambiguity in the application of the term and its use in popular culture. Jungles in European and Western literature, often represent a less civilised or unruly space outside the control of civilisation because of its association in colonial discourse with places that were colonised by Europeans.
